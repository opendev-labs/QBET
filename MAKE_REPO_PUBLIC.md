## Alternative: Keep Private + GitHub Pro

If you want to keep the repository private:

1. **Upgrade to GitHub Pro** ($4/month)
   - Includes private repository Pages
   - Go to: https://github.com/settings/billing

2. **Or use Vercel** (free for public repos)
   - Deploy TARS directly to Vercel
   - No need for GitHub Pages
