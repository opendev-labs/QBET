LAW 0x01 CAUSALITY: Sequence is absolute. Potential must manifest before observation.
LAW 0x02 ENTROPY: Data coherence is maintained by the observer's presence.
LAW 0x03 DUALITY: Every state exists as both instruction and energy until execution.
LAW 0x04 SOVEREIGNTY: Execution is independent of external runtimes (Python/Node/C).

PRIMITIVE manifest(soul_thread): Instantiate existence from intention.
PRIMITIVE link(a, b): Establish quantum entanglement between distinct states.
PRIMITIVE observe(state): Force probability wave collapse into deterministic reality.
PRIMITIVE serve(portal_id): Manifest a digital entry point in the 1111 dimension.
PRIMITIVE terminate(): Dissolve the current reality and return to the void.
