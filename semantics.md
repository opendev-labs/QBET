# Semantics for QBET Language

## Introduction
The semantics of QBET define how the language's syntax behaves and interacts with other elements. This document outlines the rules and behaviors associated with basic syntax, reflecting the interplay between digital and physical realms. In QBET, every element is a part of the cosmic dance, harmonizing the digital and physical worlds.

## 1. Variable Declaration
Variables in QBET are declared using `let`, `var`, or `const`, each serving different purposes and scopes.

```qbet
let x = 10;

- Behavior: Allocates memory for x and assigns it the value 10. This mirrors the allocation of energy in the universe, where each variable holds a specific quantum of information.
2. ExpressionsExpressions in QBET are evaluated to produce a result. They can include arithmetic operations, function calls, and more.

let sum = a + b;

- Behavior: Computes the sum of a and b, then assigns the result to sum. This reflects the natural law of addition, where combining elements creates a new entity.
3. Conditional StatementsConditional statements control the flow of execution based on boolean conditions.

if (condition) {
    statement;
}

- Behavior: Executes the statement if the condition is true. This is akin to the decision-making process in nature, where certain conditions lead to specific outcomes.
4. LoopsLoops allow repeated execution of a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.
While Loop
while (condition) {
    statement;
}

- Behavior: Repeatedly executes the statement as long as the condition is true. This mirrors the cyclical patterns found in nature, such as the orbit of planets.
For Loop
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    statement;
}

- Behavior: Executes the statement for each iteration, from i = 0 to i < 10. This reflects the iterative processes in the universe, like the growth rings of a tree.
5. FunctionsFunctions encapsulate reusable blocks of code, allowing for modular and maintainable programming.

function add(a, b) {
    return a + b;
}

- Behavior: Defines a function add that returns the sum of a and b. Functions in QBET are like the fundamental forces of nature, encapsulating specific behaviors and interactions.
6. ArraysArrays store multiple values in a single variable, accessible via indices.

let arr = [1, 2, 3];

- Behavior: Declares an array arr with three elements. Arrays in QBET are like constellations, grouping stars (values) into a coherent structure.
7. ObjectsObjects represent collections of key-value pairs, allowing for structured data storage.

let obj = {name: "QBET", type: "language"};

- Behavior: Declares an object obj with properties name and type. Objects in QBET are like organisms, with various attributes defining their state and behavior.
8. Error HandlingError handling in QBET manages exceptions and ensures robust code execution.

try {
    statement;
} catch (error) {
    handleError(error);
}

- Behavior: Executes the statement and handles any errors using handleError. This reflects the resilience of natural systems, which adapt and respond to disruptions.
9. ModulesModules allow code to be organized into separate files, promoting reusability and maintainability.

import { module } from 'moduleFile';

- Behavior: Imports module from moduleFile. Modules in QBET are like ecosystems, where different components interact and coexist harmoniously.
10. CommentsComments provide explanations and annotations within the code, improving readability and maintainability.
Single-line Comment
// This is a single-line comment

- Behavior: Adds a comment that is ignored during code execution. Comments in QBET are like the whispers of the cosmos, providing insights without altering the flow of energy.
Multi-line Comment
/* This is a
   multi-line comment */

- Behavior: Adds a multi-line comment that is ignored during code execution. Multi-line comments are like the ancient scriptures, offering detailed wisdom and guidance.
ConclusionUnderstanding the semantics of QBET is crucial for writing effective and efficient code. By adhering to these rules and best practices, developers can create harmonious and powerful applications. The unique blend of QBET's syntax and semantics ensures a robust and intuitive programming experience, reflecting the interconnectedness of the digital and physical realms.
