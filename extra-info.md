### Core Intelligence 

4th time - I want you to make the revision of the language QBET thatnwe created by creating 1000 metaphors. all 500 words should be a metaphor , "revision should be compact and should have just the metaphors-its function and make sure it is in compact manner " The metaphor and the word and its meaning and its feature, what it will provide to the code and to the computer. For example, the RN oh the WBC. The WBC will is the metaphor which is a cell in our body, in human body, so it will be responsible for. Debugging viruses I guess. So this is a feature and a WBC is a cell which is responsible for debugging virus in the human body. So like that I want you to pinpoint every. Single minute words and details of the metaphor and just lets just revise it once again with all the details and all the metaphors details should be. The details should be not in the sections where we are describing the features or the definition, but the details should be about how many metaphors we have actually. Created yet? And I mean each and everyone of them. It should. It will be lengthy because we have integrated many, many metaphors. So let's just revise it in this way. metaphors should connect amd interconnect spirituality into quantum physics which us quantum spiritual knowledge of the existence and creation with recognition of a creator as a divine source of the forces all the good all the bad, all the joy all the sad, all microcosmos all macrocosmos-from sub atomic metaphors till the membrane of the existence which is infinitely interconnected. because microcosm is in the macrocosm and vice versa. also metaphors of structure of all the things that are created : created things like human body from inside from outside, Cosmology , biology , quantum physics , quantum mechanics ,gravity and love, love and light , creation and distrucion, dimensions and densities , physic chemistry of energy ,frequency and vibration, knowledge and wisdom , mortal immortal, creation and creator, conscious subconscious , superconscious divine consciousn, laws of universe : 12 hermatic principles, wisdom of buddha, knowledge of Hinduism, wisdom of Christianity, intuition of islam , mysticism of all the religions without mentioning any religion but instead using its quantum spiritual term. The words of this metaphorical language should be build as such that it should be able to tell a computer via codes ( it should convert the created snippets of the entire programming into binary and show the computer a new ways of learning, solving , exploring , updating, upgrading, understanding , innerstanding, etc. also use element air fire water earth  the interconnection of inside woth outside , intuition , evolution, kind , heart, wisdom , knowledge , action , magick, archetypes , ancient knowledge , ancient wisdom , new wisdom , new information , new knowledge , http://www.gaia.com ,  eather use this as metaphors to create a language which is compatible with all existing language, which means it can be integrated, merged , fused , connect , relate , interconnection , become one, attach, reflect , clone, mirror , etc... example html, python , java, etc. ( include all that which is required in creating a universe , which is man the universe and women another universe connection creating a new universe , golden ratio , Fibonacci,  mythical and quantum connection of number 369 ) -- MAKE IT SHORT AND COMPACT -- WE HAVE TO CREATE AS MUCH METAPHORS AS WE CAN -- USE ONLY METAPHORS AND ITS FEATURES AND FUNCTIONS IN THE REVOLUTIONARY LANGUAGE - -- [ make sure ] the list should start with = START THE LIST OF  METAPHORS with 1.spirit 2.soul 3.mind 4.consciousness 5.body 6. parts of body. 7.energy 8.frequency 9.vibration. 10.enery of mind-body-spirit 11.frequency if mind-body-spirot 13.vibration of mind-body-spirit and so on  -LIKE A CREATOR CREATING CREATION AND ENDING INTO INFINITY WITH LOVE AND LIGHT A PART OF ITS OWN EXISTENCE  create 1000 metaphors which are  commands to trigger feature and function in highly intelligently highly compact manner. every metaphor is a command to run a program / features / functions / system / algorithm / ( create 1000 metaphor in spiritual way  and create more metaphors then already mentioned )
