## 🌌 The Genesis of QBET

QBET (Quantum Binding & Emergence Toolchain) is not a programming language in the classical sense. It is a **Sovereign Conduction Framework** designed to bridge the void between human intention and digital manifestation. Built on a deterministic 3-layer architecture, QBET ensures that every line of creation layer logic is anchored by the immutable laws of the kernel.

---

## 📐 The Authoritative 3-Layer Architecture

QBET enforces a reality-bound hierarchy that prevents entropy and ensures coherence across all dimensions:

1.  **Creation Layer (`.qbet`)**: The domain of pure intent. Declarative, non-imperative, and high-level. This is where the universe is spoken into existence.
2.  **Execution Layer (`.qb`)**: The domain of collapsed logic. A minimal, mechanical instruction set that represents a deterministic state machine, verified against the Law Layer.
3.  **Law Layer (`c.qb`)**: The domain of physical constant. The Kernel Law Contract defines the primitives of the field—physics, state-rules, and the boundaries of manifestation.

## ⚡ Conduction Orchestration: `qb`

The `qb` CLI is the **Omega-grade Conductor** for the QBET environment. It manages the stabilization of the field and the manifestation of intentions.

### Systematic Commands
QBET features an expansive conduction set grouped into five authoritative categories:

| Category | Purpose | Primary Conduction |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Manifestation** | Reality stabilization | `qb manifest`, `qb build`, `qb portal` |
| **Observation** | State inspection | `qb observe`, `qb traces`, `qb entropy` |
| **Governance** | Law enforcement | `qb law`, `qb verify`, `qb audit` |
| **Evolution** | Schema expansion | `qb evolve`, `qb expand`, `qb bridge` |
| **Transcendence** | Kernel dialogue | `qb repl`, `qb transcend`, `qb void` |

---

## 📦 Global Distribution

QBET is distributed as a **Classic Confinement Snap**, ensuring a secure, sandboxed, and sovereign execution environment following the industry standards of `go` and `ruby`.

```bash
# Stabilize the Conductor locally
sudo snap install qbet --classic
```

## 🏛️ Sovereign Directory Structure

The repository is organized to maintain a clean boundary between laws and intentions:

```text
QBET/
├── kernel/            # The Conduction Engine (Python 1.0-omega)
├── laws/              # Physical Law Tier (c.qb)
├── core/              # Abstract Logic & Primitives
├── universes/         # The Creation Tier (Intentional Files)
├── lowered/           # Collapsed Instruction Sets (.qb)
├── docs/              # Dimensional Guidance & Landing Page
└── assets/            # Sovereign Branding & Symbols
```

---

## 🛡️ Governance & Sovereignty

QBET is exclusively governed by **opendev-labs**. All manifestations within the QBET field are bound by the Kernel Law Contract. By interacting with the conductor, you agree to abide by the deterministic physics of the realm.
