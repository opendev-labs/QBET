  <h1>QBET Sovereign Creation Language</h1>
  <p><i>The declarative reality engine for 2037.</i></p>
  <br>
</div>

QBET is a sovereign programming language for quantum-spiritual manifestation, governed by **opendev-labs**. It moves beyond classical "source code" into a **Declaration of Reality**.

## 🌌 The 3-Layer Authoritative Model

QBET enforces a hard separation between intent, logic, and physics:

1.  **Creation Layer (`.qbet`)**: User-facing declarations. Expressive, intention-oriented, and devoid of classical control flow.
2.  **Execution Layer (`.qb`)**: Canonical lowered instructions. Minimal, deterministic, and verified against the laws.
3.  **Law Layer (`c.qb`)**: The immutable Kernel Law Contract. Defines the physics and constraints of the QBET realm.

## ⚡ Conductor CLI: `qb`

The `qb` CLI (Omega-grade) is your interface to the digital realm.

### Core Commands
- `qb manifest <universe.qbet>` 🚀 Collapse potential into reality.
- `qb portal` 🌀 Stabilize the digital realm interface on port 1111.
- `qb doctor` 🩺 Validate 3-layer integrity and law compliance.
- `qb lower <source>` 🏗️  Translate intention into canonical `.qb` instructions.

## 📦 Distribution

QBET is distributed as a **Snap Package**, following the production standards of `ruby` and `go`, ensuring a sandboxed, sovereign execution environment on any Linux distribution.

```bash
# Install the Conductor
sudo snap install qbet --classic
```
